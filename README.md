# Legacy-BBISLOCR
 The original Baldi's Basics in Super Lots of Content: Reloaded source code. Broken, but may be of use to some, so I figured I'd release it.
 
 NOTE: Extremely messy and unorganized. I had next to 0 programming experience when I made this, and as such a lot of it is a hodge-podge of broken formatting, horrible implementation, etc. etc.
 I do not recommend using this as reference material for your own projects.
